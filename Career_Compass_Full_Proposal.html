    <h1>Career Compass</h1>
    <h2>Full Project Proposal</h2>
    <p><strong>AI-Powered Career Guidance and Job Matching Platform</strong></p>
    <p>React + Node.js + PostgreSQL + Firebase + Multi-Source Job Aggregation</p>
    <p style="margin-top:1.4cm;"><strong>Prepared For:</strong> Project Stakeholders and Academic Review Board</p>
    <p><strong>Prepared By:</strong> Career Compass Delivery Team (6 Members)</p>
    <p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.0</p>

    <p style="margin-top:2.2cm;" class="small">Confidential proposal document for planning, implementation, and execution of Career Compass over a 12-week delivery timeline.</p>
  </section>

  <div class="page-break"></div>
  <section>
    <h2>Page 2: Executive Summary and Proposal Purpose</h2>
    <p>Career Compass is proposed as a full-stack, production-oriented digital platform designed to improve how individuals discover, evaluate, and pursue careers that match their personal strengths. The platform solves a common failure point in career planning: users often apply randomly, without structured alignment between interests, personality, capabilities, and labor market demand. This results in inefficient applications, low confidence, and poor role fit.</p>
    <p>The proposed solution integrates three user-signal dimensions: MBTI profile, RIASEC profile, and selected skills. These signals are processed through a weighted hybrid scoring engine that calculates role fit and identifies skill gaps. The platform then links users to real openings through job aggregation providers and supports continuity by storing analysis history and path checklists for authenticated users. This turns one-time assessment into an actionable career improvement workflow.</p>
    <p>This proposal defines both technical execution and delivery operations. It includes: system architecture, data model, API design, UI/UX behavior, security and privacy approach, risk management, team structure, role assignments across six members, and a 12-week phased implementation plan with measurable outputs. The proposal also documents how technologies are used in detail, how integrations are configured, and how the platform can adapt to custom job APIs through provider abstraction.</p>
    <p>Expected outcomes of the 12-week implementation are: a working production-grade MVP, documented setup and operations process, baseline quality assurance coverage, and a demonstrable pipeline from user assessment to opportunity application. Success is measured by functional completeness, reliability of key flows, clarity of user guidance, and maintainability of the codebase for future scale.</p>

  <div class="page-break"></div>
  <section>
    <h2>Page 3: Problem Statement, Opportunity, and Context</h2>
    <h3>Problem Definition</h3>
    <p>Current career decision patterns are frequently unstructured. Many learners and job seekers rely on fragmented sources: generic advice articles, informal recommendations, and disconnected job boards. Most tools provide either personality tests without labor-market connection, or job listings without personal-fit guidance. As a result, users do not know which role families to prioritize, which skills to develop first, and where to apply with the highest probability of long-term fit.</p>
    <h3>Observed Gaps</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No unified mechanism for combining personality indicators with practical skills.</li>
      <li>Limited visibility into job requirement gaps at the individual level.</li>
      <li>Poor continuity: users cannot consistently track progress over time.</li>
      <li>Weak connection between assessment output and actionable application pathways.</li>
      <li>Lack of transparent scoring logic in many recommendation systems.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Opportunity</h3>
    <p>Career Compass addresses these gaps by introducing a structured and transparent model that connects profile analysis to real jobs. It does not attempt to replace human coaching; instead, it provides an evidence-based decision support layer for users to move faster and more confidently. The opportunity includes educational institutions, bootcamp learners, graduates, early-career professionals, and career-switchers who need practical and personalized direction.</p>
    <h3>Value Proposition</h3>
    <p>The platform delivers practical value in three ways: first, it narrows career options to high-fit targets; second, it transforms requirements into a clear checklist and upskilling path; third, it connects users to live opportunities. The combined effect is better application quality, reduced decision fatigue, and improved readiness for role transitions.</p>

  </section>

  <div class="page-break"></div>
  <section>
    <h2>Page 6: System Architecture (High-Level)</h2>
    <h3>Architecture Pattern</h3>
    <p>The solution follows a layered, modular architecture with clear boundaries:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Presentation Layer:</strong> React frontend handling UI, routing, and user interactions.</li>
      <li><strong>API Layer:</strong> Express routes/controllers handling request orchestration and validation.</li>
      <li><strong>Domain/Service Layer:</strong> business logic (scoring, sync, checklist workflows).</li>
      <li><strong>Data Access Layer:</strong> repositories with SQL operations via PostgreSQL pool.</li>
      <li><strong>Persistence Layer:</strong> PostgreSQL tables with constraints, indexes, and migrations.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Request Lifecycle Example</h3>
    <p>A career analysis request starts at frontend selection inputs and moves through API validation, scoring services, lookup enrichment, optional user history recording, then returns ranked results. This keeps frontend thin while preserving backend consistency and testability.</p>
    <h3>Operational Flow for Jobs</h3>
    <p>Job sync is triggered via API. Provider adapter fetches raw jobs, normalization transforms to unified schema, career ranking maps jobs to known paths, and repository upserts records into `jobs`. Frontend then reads normalized jobs through a single endpoint, independent of source provider.</p>
    <h3>Scalability and Extensibility Notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Provider abstraction allows adding new APIs without frontend changes.</li>
      <li>Repository pattern centralizes SQL and supports gradual optimization.</li>
      <li>Stateless API routes support horizontal scaling with external sessionless auth.</li>
      <li>Migrations maintain schema evolution discipline for team collaboration.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <div class="page-break"></div>
  <section>
    <h2>Page 7: Frontend Technical Design (Used and How)</h2>
    <h3>Core Technologies Used</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>React with Vite build tooling.</li>
      <li>Hash-based client routing (custom hook).</li>
      <li>Firebase Auth SDK for identity and session state.</li>
      <li>Custom CSS variable system for theme and visual consistency.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How It Is Implemented</h3>
    <p>The frontend is organized by responsibility: `pages` for route-level screens, `components` for reusable UI, `services` for API calls, `context` for auth state, and `hooks` for routing/SEO behavior. This structure reduces coupling and supports iterative feature growth.</p>
    <p>Navigation relies on hash routes (`#/home`, `#/analysis`, etc.) to avoid server-side routing dependencies during local and static deployments. The custom route hook normalizes valid routes and redirects invalid paths to home.</p>
    <p>Theme management is state-driven. On app initialization, theme is loaded from local storage or user system preference. Toggling updates `document.documentElement.dataset.theme`, enabling CSS variable swapping for light/dark mode without component rewrites.</p>
    <h3>Auth UX Flow</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Dedicated Login page presents Google and email/password options.</li>
      <li>Firebase state listener updates app-level auth context.</li>
      <li>Token is attached to protected API requests through service client options.</li>
      <li>Logout clears session and user context, then guarded pages show proper state.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>UI/UX Principles Applied</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Glassmorphism cards with clear hierarchy and readable contrast.</li>
      <li>Responsive behavior for mobile and desktop layouts.</li>
      <li>Safe external links (`noopener noreferrer`) for test links/job links.</li>
      <li>Progressive interaction: analysis output, then requirement path tracking.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <div class="page-break"></div>
  <section>
    <h2>Page 8: Backend Technical Design (Used and How)</h2>
    <h3>Core Backend Stack</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Node.js runtime + Express framework.</li>
      <li>PostgreSQL driver (`pg`) with pooled connections.</li>
      <li>Zod request validation.</li>
      <li>Middleware chain for CORS, security headers, logging, auth, and error handling.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Layer Responsibilities</h3>
    <table>
      <tr><th>Layer</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Example</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Routes</td><td>Endpoint registration</td><td>`/analysis/recommendations`</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Controllers</td><td>Input parsing and response formatting</td><td>Analyze payload validation and response envelope</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Services</td><td>Business logic orchestration</td><td>Scoring, job sync, tracking workflows</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Repositories</td><td>Database read/write SQL</td><td>Lookup retrieval, checklist updates</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Adapters</td><td>External API integrations</td><td>Remotive, Adzuna, custom jobs provider</td></tr>
    </table>
    <h3>Error Handling and Stability</h3>
    <p>Controllers throw typed HTTP errors for invalid payloads or authorization failures. Global error middleware ensures consistent JSON responses and avoids leaking stack traces to clients in standard operation. Job provider failures use controlled fallback behavior where configured to reduce user disruption.</p>
    <h3>Authentication Verification Path</h3>
    <p>Optional Firebase Admin verification validates bearer tokens when credentials are configured. If not configured, mock fallback can be retained for local development. Protected routes use middleware that requires resolved user identity before allowing tracking/history operations.</p>
  </section>

  <div class="page-break"></div>
  <section>
    <h2>Page 9: Database Design and Data Governance</h2>
    <h3>Schema Overview</h3>
    <p>The schema models three major domains: (1) career intelligence (careers, skills, certifications, mappings), (2) market data (jobs, job sources, world stats), and (3) user progression (analysis history, checklist items).</p>
    <h3>Key Modeling Choices</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Many-to-many tables capture career-to-skill, career-to-mbti, and career-to-riasec weights.</li>
      <li>Normalized requirement records support transparent recommendation explanations.</li>
      <li>JSONB fields preserve provider payloads for traceability and future enrichment.</li>
      <li>Unique constraints prevent duplicate job ingestion from repeated sync runs.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Data Quality Controls</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Check constraints enforce valid enumerations (experience level, checklist item type).</li>
      <li>Indexed foreign keys support fast joins on recommendation and path queries.</li>
      <li>Seed scripts use upsert patterns for idempotent repeatability.</li>
      <li>Migrations are tracked in `schema_migrations` to preserve sequence integrity.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Seed Strategy</h3>
    <p>The current seed includes more than 100 skills and at least 120 baseline jobs to ensure functional demonstration even during upstream API instability. This prevents empty states during demonstrations and initial tests while preserving compatibility with live sync providers.</p>
  </section>

  <div class="page-break"></div>
  <section>
    <h2>Page 10: Recommendation Engine and Decision Logic</h2>
    <h3>Hybrid Weighted Scoring Formula</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Skill match coverage: 50%</li>
      <li>RIASEC alignment: 30%</li>
      <li>MBTI alignment: 20%</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This weighting was selected to balance practical employability (skills) with role-style compatibility (personality indicators). It intentionally prioritizes tangible capability while preserving behavioral fit factors.</p>
    <h3>Scoring Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Normalize user-selected inputs (skills, MBTI, RIASEC).</li>
      <li>Load active career profiles with weighted mappings.</li>
      <li>Compute partial coverage across each scoring dimension.</li>
      <li>Aggregate weighted total and bound to percentage scale.</li>
      <li>Sort and return top recommendations with breakdown details.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Skill Gap Logic</h3>
    <p>For each recommended career, required skills not selected by user are flagged as skill gaps. Gaps are sorted by importance, enabling users to prioritize upskilling in high-impact areas first.</p>
    <h3>Explainability and Trust</h3>
    <p>Each recommendation includes breakdown data (skill, RIASEC, MBTI contribution), matched signals, and required certifications. This transparency avoids black-box recommendations and improves user trust and self-directed action planning.</p>
  </section>

  <div class="page-break"></div>
  <section>
    <h2>Page 11: External Integrations (Jobs APIs, Firebase, and Custom Provider)</h2>
    <h3>Jobs Integration Strategy</h3>
    <p>Career Compass supports multiple job providers under a single normalization pipeline. The provider is controlled by environment configuration:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>`remotive`: public remote jobs API</li>
      <li>`adzuna`: requires `app_id` and `app_key`</li>
      <li>`custom`: user-defined endpoint and field path mapping</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Adzuna Configuration (Current Credential Model)</h3>
    <p>Requests include credentials in query parameters (`app_id`, `app_key`) per Adzuna API style. Country and page are configurable for market scope and pagination control.</p>
    <h3>Custom Provider Configuration</h3>
    <p>For custom APIs, the system supports method control (`GET`/`POST`), custom headers JSON (for tokens), results path extraction (e.g. `data.items`), and search/limit parameter naming. This allows integration with proprietary job backends without changing core business logic.</p>
    <h3>Firebase Integration</h3>
    <p>Frontend uses Firebase Authentication for Google and email/password login. Backend optionally verifies Firebase ID tokens using Firebase Admin credentials for protected user tracking operations.</p>
    <h3>Failure Handling</h3>
    <p>If provider fetch fails, controlled fallback jobs can be injected (for default providers) to avoid total user-blocking errors. Failures are returned as structured API responses for diagnostics while maintaining platform continuity.</p>
  </section>

  <div class="page-break"></div>
  <section>
    <h2>Page 12: Security, Privacy, Compliance, and Reliability</h2>
    <h3>Security Controls</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Input validation at API boundary (`zod`).</li>
      <li>Helmet-based security headers.</li>
      <li>CORS restricted by configured origin.</li>
      <li>Authenticated route protection for history/checklist endpoints.</li>
      <li>Sensitive credentials moved to environment variables.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Privacy and Data Handling</h3>
    <p>User tracking data is limited to platform-relevant activity: selected inputs, top recommendations, and checklist completion status. Personally identifiable information scope is minimized to authenticated account identity and required metadata for feature operation.</p>
    <h3>Operational Reliability</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Health endpoint enables runtime checks.</li>
      <li>Migration/seed scripts provide deterministic environment setup.</li>
      <li>Seed baseline prevents empty datasets during API outages.</li>
      <li>Single command startup script reduces local run-time errors.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Compliance Considerations</h3>
    <p>In future phases, policy upgrades should include explicit data retention policy, account deletion workflow, audit logging for access-sensitive actions, and legal review for multi-region privacy obligations where applicable.</p>
  </section>

  <div class="page-break"></div>
  <section>
    <h2>Page 13: Quality Assurance, Testing, and Deployment Plan</h2>
    <h3>Testing Strategy</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Static checks:</strong> syntax checks and build verification for frontend/backend.</li>
      <li><strong>Integration checks:</strong> key API endpoint verification (`health`, `lookups`, `analysis`, `jobs`, `tracking`).</li>
      <li><strong>Data checks:</strong> post-seed minimum record assertions (skills/jobs counts).</li>
      <li><strong>User-flow tests:</strong> login, analysis run, checklist update, sign-out.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Release Readiness Criteria</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No blocker defects in auth, analysis, jobs, or persistence flows.</li>
      <li>Documentation complete and reproducible setup validated.</li>
      <li>Fallback behavior tested for network and provider failures.</li>
      <li>Core UI responsive on desktop and mobile breakpoints.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Deployment Plan (MVP)</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Provision managed PostgreSQL and API runtime environment.</li>
      <li>Configure production env values for Firebase and jobs providers.</li>
      <li>Run migrations and seed scripts in target environment.</li>
      <li>Deploy backend and frontend with proper CORS and base URL configuration.</li>
      <li>Execute smoke tests and publish release notes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Post-Deployment Monitoring</h3>
    <p>Track API error rates, sync success rates, auth failures, and user progression usage. This telemetry informs tuning of scoring assumptions and next-phase product decisions.</p>

    <h2>Page 16: Budget, Risk Register, Sustainability, and Conclusion</h2>
    <h3>Resource and Budget Categories (Indicative)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Human effort: six-member delivery team over 12 weeks.</li>
      <li>Infrastructure: PostgreSQL host, API host, frontend hosting, monitoring tools.</li>
      <li>Third-party services: Firebase Auth, optional paid job API tiers.</li>
      <li>Contingency: 10-15% for integration variability and scope adjustments.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Top Risks and Mitigations</h3>
    <table>
      <tr><th>Risk</th><th>Impact</th><th>Mitigation</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Upstream jobs API downtime</td><td>Reduced live listings</td><td>Provider fallback + seeded baseline records.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Credential misconfiguration</td><td>Auth/sync failures</td><td>Environment templates + startup validation checks.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Scope expansion during build</td><td>Timeline slip</td><td>Change control through Product Lead and weekly approvals.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Data quality drift</td><td>Recommendation trust loss</td><td>Versioned seed updates + periodic mapping review.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Integration regressions</td><td>Broken user flows</td><td>Pre-release test matrix and smoke checks.</td></tr>
    </table>
    <h3>Sustainability and Next Steps</h3>
    <p>The proposed architecture supports incremental growth. Future phases can include recommendation feedback loops, deeper labor-market analytics, localized role catalogs, and coaching workflows. Because provider integration is abstracted, regional job APIs can be added without redesigning the frontend experience.</p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>This proposal presents a practical, implementable, and maintainable 12-week plan to deliver Career Compass as a high-value MVP. It combines technical rigor, user-centered workflow design, transparent recommendation logic, and clear team accountability. With this plan, the project can move from build to deployment with measurable outcomes and a foundation ready for scale.</p>
    <p><strong>Approval Requested:</strong> Confirm proposal acceptance, assign named members to roles, and authorize Week 1 kickoff under this timeline.</p>
